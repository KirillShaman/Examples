CurveExample
================

The following equations arise in studying ROC curves.

If `x(t) = 1 - pbeta(t, b, a); y(t) = 1 - pbeta(t, a, b))` (`pbeta`
being the incomplete gamma function) then `(1 - y)^(1/s) + x^(1/s) = 1`
where `s = log(1 - pbeta(0.5, b, a)) / log(0.5)`. I can show the case
where `a=1`, as in this case the incomplete beta function is a simple
polynomial. However, as we see many more cases also appear to be true.
All I would need to complete a proof is to show `x(t) = 1 - pbeta(t, 1,
s); y(t) = 1 - pbeta(t, s, 1))` is the same curve as `x(t) = 1 -
pbeta(t, b, a); y(t) = 1 - pbeta(t, a, b))` or the same as `(1 -
y)^(1/s) + x^(1/s) = 1` (obviously parameterized at a different rate),
and all is done.

A numeric example in [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) can be found
[here](https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/rebalance/CurveExample.md).

It seems like this may take more than polynomial algebra. Maybe set up
an ODE on the derivatives of `x(t)` and `y(t)`, but I havenâ€™t seen a
good wat to de-parameterize the equations. Alternately is there an
obvious symmetry of the incomplete beta that moves the parameteric beta
forms from (a,b) to (1,s) which would also complete the proof.

It is easy to show that `x = 1 - pbeta(t, 1, s); y = 1 - pbeta(t, s, 1)`
is on the curve `(1 - y)^(1/s) + x^(1/s) = 1` (notes
[here](https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/rebalance/ROC_shape.md)).

How does one show the curve `x = 1 - pbeta(t, a, b); y = 1 - pbeta(t, b,
a)` is coincident with these two curves?
